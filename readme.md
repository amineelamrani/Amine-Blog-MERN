# Amine Blog Project

Welcome to the repository of my Blog App built using the MERN Stack. Below, you will find everything you need to know about the project, the tech stack and how to get started.

## üåü Features

- Full Stack MERN Application : Built using the MERN Stack.
- Authentication and Authorization using the JWT (JSON Web Token).
- Oauth using google Firebase auth.
- Real time data Vizualization for the Admin using ChartJS.
- Email notification using Nodemail for email confirmation and password reset.
- Beautiful and responsive design using DaisyUI and TailwindCSS.
- Dark/white themes and the possibility to store the preferred theme for the user so he could find it in next time.
- Image storage managed with cloudinary
- SPA via React Router.
- Robuste state management using redux and redux toolkit + Redux persist.

## üõ†Ô∏è Process  
Building this MERN Blog was an exciting journey, and I approached it with a systematic and organized mindset (thanks to my background as a Systems Engineer in the automotive industry). Here's how I brought this project to life, step by step:  
1. Requirements and planning
- Top-to-Bottom Approach: I started by defining the requirements, deciding on features, and then moved to the implementation phase.
- Brainstorming : I used Excalidraw to map out the project‚Äôs features, steps and features plan, data modeling for the backend (embedding, referencing, ...) and tech stacks selections .... (see the excalidraw extract below).

2. Design
I created the design prototypes using Figma to ensure a clean, user-friendly interface.
3. Project Management
I used Notion App to plan and track the project‚Äôs progress, breaking it down into tasks, milestones, and deadlines.

> P.s.: This project took longer than expected because I was working full-time as a Systems Engineer. There were times when I had to work in the office, which limited the time I could dedicate to programming. This experience has inspired me to create a better action plan for organizing my time and energy when working in the office, so I can dedicate more time to projects like this, Insha'Allah. üí™
